{Comment:
2\C = Six cards, 11-17 HCP, or five cards only if maximum.
2\H = Non forcing, to play either 2\H or 2\S.
Pass (East) = A bit too weak for 3\C...
West shifts to \D after the first two \C tricks. East takes the Queen with the King and returns a trump. Win the King and duck a \S.
West insists in \H. Win the Ace and ruff a \D. When the Jack drops, ruff a \S, cash the 10 of \D and crossruff the next three tricks.

{Comment:
1\S = Here comes again that discussion about black two-suiters. Here is our proposition :
- At matchpoints, open 1\S to make interventions more difficult for your opponents.
- In a team event, open 1\S with 12-14 H hands and 1\C with stronger hands.
The establisment of your side suit is necessary. Ruff the third \D and ruff a \C at once.
Cross to the 10 of \S and ruff another \C with the Ace.
Clear the remaining trumps and claim ten good tricks.
If you give three rounds of trumps before ruffing a \C, you are "dead". Try it.

{Comment:
With the Queen of trumps on side, you make eight tricks : five \H, two \S and the Ace of \C.
North could have protected with 3\D, a contract which goes one down unless East-West decide to bid again, in which case they are likely to go down.
At matchpoints, protecting with a good six-card suit at favourable vulnerability is a winning policy.

Sequence 2 : X = Takeout for \C and \H.
3\S = Preemptive.
Nine tricks in a \S contract, provided declarer handles trumps according to probabilities : no finesse with nine cards. Anyway, should you decide to finesse, you would do it against South because of North's 3\C bid.

{Comment:
Four losers : thre \S and a \D. You could just bet on the Ace of \S lying in North, but you can do better. With long trumps in both hands, you must think of an elimination and throw-in endplay.
Win the second \D, draw trumps and handle \C in safety : Ace, King and low to Queen-9. - If North discards, throw South in with the fourth \C. - If the 10 or the Jack dropped on the second round and North follows, finesse the 9. If the suit breaks 4-2, you have ten tricks. Else South makes this trick but he must surrender the King of \S.
Agree, this play is more adapted to team play, but training for safety plays cannot harm...

This favourable lead presents you with a sixth trick. You have two options for the seventh :
- A 3-2 \S break (68% probability of success).
- Split honours in \H (75%).
It's a no brainer. Cross to the King of \S and lead a low \H to the 10. Win the return and repeat the manoeuvre. Just made.

Ruff the \D lead and draw five rounds of trumps, watching the discards carefully. West will probably discard one \S and two \D...
Next cash the three \C honours and endplay West with the fourth \C. He is forced to play into your \S tenace. Unless he decided to discard a second spade... in which case you go down.

{Comment:
2\D = Game forcing. 2\H = No ace, no points. 2NT = 24 HCP or more.
3\C = Puppet Stayman. 3\D = One or both four-card major(s). 3\H = Four cards in \S.
3NT = I have \H. 5NT = 6-7 HCP. 6NT = Proposition accepted.
You count eleven direct tricks afte the \S lead (of course, South does not rise with the King)
For the missing trick, you have two chances, which you can cumulate :
- making three \H tricks, by finessing first and cashing Ace-King.
- or making four \D tricks if the Jack drops.
Both solutions work. Just start with \H.

{Comment:
Despite his 13 HCP, North cannot double for takeout because of his \H shortness.
However, on the second round, after his opponents have expressed their \H fit, he must double for \S and \D.
Two \H, one \D and one \C : those will be East-West's four tricks.
North-South pairs who allowed their opponents to play in 2\H will not get rich.

{Comment:
2\D = Two-suiter, non forcing, 12-18 LHCP.
2\H = Preference.
Win the \C lead with the Queen - rather unfortunate for the defense but who can blame West? - and unblock the Ace of \S.
Continue with a \C to the Ace, \S ruffed, \H to the Ace, \C ruffed and King-Queen of \H. These two ruffs in the long hand make eight tricks in all.

{Comment:
2\H = Six good cards, 6-10 HCP.
4\H = Let's hope \H are solid or semi-solid.
Win the Ace of \S and try the \H finesse. When it succeeds, cross to the King of \C and repeat it. When North discards, you must shorten your hand to the same number of trumps as South. This can be done by ruffing two \S.
Ace of \C, \S ruffed. Ace of \D, \S ruffed. Exit in either minor and wait to make two tricks with \HAce-Queen.

{Comment:
2\C = Semi-forcing. 2\D = Waiting bid. 2NT = 22-23 HCP. 3\C = Puppet Stayman.
3\D = One or both four-card major(s). 3\H = Four cards in \S. 3\S = Me too.
4\H = Control. 5\D = One key. 5\H = What about the trump Queen?
6\H = I have it too, with the \H King.
Win the King of \D and draw two rounds of trumps. When West discards, continue with the Queen of \H (East following with the 8, to show two cards). West ducks and wins the next \H to insist with a third round. Ruff high and claim twelve tricks : four trumps, one ruff, one \H, to \D and four \C.
To score a top, North-South pairs must bid 6NT.

{Comment:
1NT = 12-14 HCP.
It takes North a lot of work to bring home this modest contract...
The King of \H makes the first trick and a \D goes to the Jack and East's Queen. The declarer wins the \H continuation and establishes his \D. East insists in \H.
Two good \D are followed by the Queen of \C taken by the King. West cashes his \H thirteener but must surrender the seventh trick, in either black suit.

{Comment:
3\H = Invitational.
Can East hold the King of \H?
The answer is no : he has already shown the King of \S and he passed over his partner's opening.
How do you know that he has the King of \S?
Because West failed to lead a \S. With Ace-King, he would not have led a \D.
Therefore, you win the 9 of Damonds and cash the Ace of \H. When the King drops, continue with the Queen, unblock the Ace of \D and cross to the Jack of \H. Discard dummy's \S on your \D, concede the Ace of \C and claim twelve tricks.

{Comment:
Do not duck the \S lead. If you did, North could switch to \H, which would endanger your contract.
Lead the 2 of \D to the 10. When it holds, change your plans, because most likely, \D cannot be exploited. Shift to \C, by finessing the Jack. The Ace of \H will allow you to repeat the \C finesse for nine tricks.

{Comment:
3\C = Seven card preempt.
5\C = To make (one never knows) or to go down less than four tricks, white against red.
5\S = Because of the vulnerabilities.
The declarer wins the Ace of \C and ruffs his loser in dummy. He passes the Queen of \S to West's King and the \H return goes to the Jack and East's Queen.
East realised that the \C2 opening lead was a preference signal and he duly returns a \D ruffed by East. One down thanks to this good defense. The 5\C contract would have gone two down.

{Comment:
2\D = Fourth suit forcing.
2\H = Three cards, first opening area (12-14 HCP).
With two \D losers, you can afford to lose only one \C.
What his the best way to make three \C tricks? Certainly not the finesse but rather to play twice to the small honours. East will make the King but you will have three tricks and your contract.

{Comment:
4\H = Slam hopes are slim.
Finessing the 9 of \D secures the contract if the 10 lies in South. But you go down if it shows up in North.
There is a better way to make ten tricks. Cross to the Ace of \S and lead the 9 f \D.
A) North wins : you lose only two \D and possibly the King of \H.
B) North plays low : South wins the trick but he cannot return a trump without sacrificing the King. After conceding North the King of \D, you will hop up onthe Ace on the trump return to ruff your last \D.

{Comment:
2\H = Fourth suit forcing, looking for a \H stopper.
After the normal \H lead, the declarer ducks a \D and ends up with nine or eleven tricks depending on his handling of the \C.
Looking for the Queen in South is slightly better from a technical points of view, and not only because of the saying "The Queen follows the Jack".

{Comment:
1\S = For some players, this bid shows five cards or more. Anyway, West is minimum.
3\H = Preemptive raise with at least four cards.
South wins the Queen of \H and realises that he needs a \D trick to set the contract. Therefore, he shifts to a low \D, East capturing North's King with the Ace. The declarer draws two rounds of trumps and passes the 10 of \C. South wins the King and insists in \D. East cashes the \C but North ruffs and cashes the setting trick in \D.
Nice defense.

To secure your contract, duck the first \H. When you gain the lead, cash the King of \S and lead a low \S to the 10. Even if West wins the Queen, the King of \C is protected and you will be able to discard one of your losers on dummy's fourth \D. When the 10 of \S holds, you have eleven tricks.

You have ten sure tricks. Although both the Ace of \H and the King of \D are likely to lie in East, you can secure your contract. Ruff the King of \S, cash the Ace of \C and cross to the King of \C to lead a \H to the 9. East is forced to surrender the eleventh trick either in \S, \H or \D. Notrump addicts will score a better result on this board...

{Comment:
1\S = Five cards or more for some players, four or more for others.
1NT = 12-14 HCP, balanced.
With four top tricks, you need to find five more in the minors, as \S do not look attractive.
Win the first \H and tackle \D at once to blow first South possible entry. South insists in \H. Now, you must duck. This way, the \C finesse is riskless as North cannot communicate with his partner.

{Comment:
A sequenced suit, even of three cards, is less risky than a fourth best.
The cardplay :
1) Win the Ace of \C.
2) and 3) Cash Ace-King of \D head-on, because the dumy has only one entry. Thank you for the Queen.
4) et 5) Jack of \D and \C ducked.
As the cards lie, no defense can prevent you from making ten tricks and a very good score rewards this neat play.

{Comment:
You have one loser too many and you must establish a second \C trick.
If trumps break 4-1, your contract is doomed. Therefore cash Ace- King of \H, the Ace of \C and lead the 9 of \C. When East plays low smoothly, West wins the Jack. He cashes the Queen of \H and and shifts back to \D. Win the King, cross to the King of \S and discard your \D on the Queen of \C (loser upon loser). East wins the King but you can discard your \S loser on the 10 of \C.

North wins the King and returns his last trump : you are in trouble.
Lead a \S to the King and South's Ace. Win the \H return, ruff a \H and lead a \S to the Jack. When the smoke clears, write 100 in the wrong column.

{Comment:
No comment on the bidding : simple and to the point.
No comment either on the card play where twelve tricks are easy provided you handle \C with the Ace first.
Just one remark though : overcalling 1\S with East's hand is not completely ridiculous. It can disturb the opponents' dialog or give an opening lead. On this board, as a side effect, it could induce South to cash the King of \C first and to finesse the 10...

{Comment:
2\H = Can you open a weak-two with two aces? Experts disagree on this question. What is more important is not to have two defensive tricks outside the long suit. Therefore our answer is Yes.
4\H = Multi-purpose : either to make or to sacrifice against a winning contract.
Pass (South) = Impossible to double with only two \S. 4NT would give a good result as 5\D only goes one down but this bid is less than obvious.
South must follow with the 2 of \D, on partner's opening lead of the Queen. With a singleton in dummy, this is a preferensce signal for \C. When North duly complies, declarer should play the King but, if he plays low, South wins the Jack and he should now cash the Ace to hold declarer to ten tricks. Else, West will cash all his winners and eventually Ace-King of \S to drop the Queen and discard his \C on the Jack. A difficult defense.
